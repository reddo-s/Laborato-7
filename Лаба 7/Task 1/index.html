                18-year-old Michael Cook in self-defense. While Radke did not shoot Cook, he was indicted on charges relating to owning
                brass knuckles that he brought to that altercation. These charges, combined with Radke's past troubles with narcotics
                and rehab, led to five years probation. After he failed to report to his probation officer, he was arrested in June
                2008, where his probation was revoked and he was mandated to serve his original sentence of two years in prison...

            <p class="article" id="mobile">
                On April 21, 2020, the band's guitarist Derek Jones died at the age of 35, which was confirmed by Ronnie Radke on his
                official Twitter account. Here's what Ronnie wrote: "I'll never forget when you picked me up from prison in your old van
                to start Falling in Reverse. Your soul will forever be woven into the music I write. Rest in peace Derek Jones. My heart
                is broken." <br> <br>    The message was accompanied by four photos of the late guitarist, who officially joined the band in 2010 and
